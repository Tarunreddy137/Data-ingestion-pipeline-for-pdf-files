# Data-ingestion-pipeline-for-pdf- files (Unstructured to Structured)
## Overview
This project provides a complete pipeline to ingest and transform unstructured text from PDF files into a structured format ready for analysis, reporting, or further processing. It includes PDF extraction, preprocessing, structured transformation, pipeline metrics, and export to standard formats.
## Data Ingestion Layer (PDF Input)
The ingestion layer extracts raw, unstructured data from PDF documents and transforms it into a machine-readable tabular format.
### Key Steps:
	Load PDF files from a local path, cloud storage, or API.
	Extract textual content using libraries such as:
	PyMuPDF (fitz)
	pdfminer.six
	pdfplumber
	Parse content by:
	Identifying headers, tables, and key-value pairs
	Splitting paragraphs or sections by logical structure
	Extract specific entities (e.g., names, dates, titles, transaction details)
	Convert extracted fields into a structured format (e.g., Pandas DataFrame)
	Log ingestion stats such as number of pages, parsing success, errors
### Supported Input:
	pdf files (text-based or table-based, not image scans)
	Batch directory or single file
## Preprocessing Layer
Once raw text is extracted from PDFs, the preprocessing layer standardizes, cleans, and validates the structured data.
### Key Operations:
	Clean extracted strings (remove newlines, special characters, and escape sequences)
	Normalize whitespace, casing, punctuation
	Parse date and time fields into standard formats
	Validate extracted field types and completeness
	Remove duplicates or irrelevant lines
	Enrich with external reference data (optional)
	Organize structured content into consistent schema
Optional Enhancements:
	Apply Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract custom tags
	Use regular expressions for key-value pair extraction
	Remove headers/footers/artifacts using layout rules
## Pipeline Metrics
To monitor and manage data flow from PDF to structured output, the pipeline collects processing metrics.
### Tracked Metrics:
| Metric Name           | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `files_processed`     | Number of PDF files ingested                       |
| `pages_read`          | Total pages read across all PDFs                   |
| `text_extracted`      | Character or word count of extracted text          |
| `records_created`     | Structured entries generated after parsing         |
| `parsing_errors`      | Count of failed or partially parsed pages/files    |
| `processing_time_sec` | Total time taken to ingest and transform all files |
| `pipeline_status`     | Pipeline run status (Success, Fail, Incomplete)    |
### Monitoring Options:
	Log files in logs/
	Real-time dashboards (optional): Prometheus, ELK Stack, Airflow UI
## Structured Output Layer
The final output is a clean, structured dataset extracted from raw PDF text, formatted for database insertion or analytical use.
### Output Format Options:
	CSV
	Parquet
	SQL Table (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
	JSON (if semi-structured output needed)
### Example Structured Schema:
| Column Name       | Type      | Description                              |
| ----------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `document_id`     | VARCHAR   | Unique file or document identifier       |
| `entity_name`     | TEXT      | Name or keyword extracted from PDF       |
| `section_header`  | TEXT      | Title or header for grouped content      |
| `content_snippet` | TEXT      | Extracted paragraph or line of interest  |
| `timestamp`       | TIMESTAMP | Date and time if extracted from document |
| `source_path`     | TEXT      | File path or URL of original PDF file    |
### Output Destination:
	Saved locally to /output/
	Inserted into a relational database
	Written to cloud storage or data warehouse
### Running the Pipeline
python run_pipeline.py \
  --input ./data/raw_pdfs/ \
  --output ./output/structured_data.csv \

### Future Enhancements
	Add OCR support (Tesseract) for scanned PDFs
	Automate with Airflow or Prefect for scheduled runs
	Integrate NLP (spaCy) for contextual entity extraction
	Add schema validation with Great Expectations
	Version control for extracted data with DVC or Delta Lake
